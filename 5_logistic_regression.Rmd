# Logistic Regression

Load the train data set on which ROSE was applied
```{r}
train_rose <- read.csv("data/train_rose.csv")
test <- read.csv("data/test.csv")
```

Fit the model
```{r}
logistic_model <- glm(CARAVAN ~ ., data = train_rose, family = "binomial")
```

```{r}
summary(logistic_model)
```

```{r}
x_test <- test[, !names(test) == "CARAVAN"]
# Make vote predictions
y_pred <- as.numeric(predict(logistic_model, x_test, type = "response") > 0.5)
```
Make predictions of the test set

```{r}
#Confusion matrix
library(caret)
#change the positive class to 1
confusionMatrix(factor(y_pred), factor(test$CARAVAN), positive = "1")
```
